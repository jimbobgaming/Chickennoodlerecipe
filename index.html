    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Premade rotisserie chicken breast OR cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 Large Onion</li>
        <li>2-3 Celery strips</li>
        <li>Carrots (I get the precut ones that are shredded style)</li>
        <li>Knots Chicken Cubes (pack of 6 cubes)</li>
        <li>Small mini noodles (Look's like rice)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn stove on medium and put 6 cups of water in large soup pot and put 2tbs of salt and 3tbs of pepper then put the chicken cubes in and slightly stir and let dissolve.</li>
        <br />
        <li>While the cubes dissolve dice the whole onion into small as possible pieces, then cut the 2-3 celery sticks.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Once all the cutting is done put the ingredients in the pot and stir and throw in 3 handfuls of the pre-cut carrots.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Put the top of the pot on and turn heat up to medium-high and let sit for 30 minutes make sure the water goes to a boil if not turn up the heat.<br />
            Note: (While this goes you can start shredding and ripping apart the chicken make sure there is no skin on the breasts when shredding)</li>
        <br />
        <li>After 30 minutes put another half cup of water in the pot and add another handful of carrots (thisâ€™ll be the rest of the carrots you use). Now let it sit for another 20 minutes with the top of pot on.</li>    
        <br />
        <li>After the 20 minutes is up put the pieces of chicken in and half cup of the small noodles. (You can always add more later) and turn heat to medium-low and let sit for another 20 minutes.</li>
        <br />
        <li>After 10-15 minutes check up on the soup and if the noodles are absorbing too much water put 3 quarters cup of water in and let sit for 10 minutes or if not enough noodles put in more and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        <br />
        <li>After the 5-10 minutes after checking up on it your soup is done.</li>
    </ol>
